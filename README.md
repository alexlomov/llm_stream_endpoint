# llm_stream_endpoint
Minimal llm rust api streaming endpoint.

It is a  minimalist service to interact with a LLM, in a streaming mode.

It is designed to run quantized version of mistral or phi-2 quantized model, on a CPU

It is a very simple Rest Streaming API using :
* Rust
* Warp
* Candle


# How to use the service


> The selection of the model is activated by a feature, either mistral or phi-2 ( by default) 
>
> A Makefile facilitates clean,update, build,run
> 
> Prior to execution , please run :
>
> *make clean*
> 
> and then 
> 
> *make update*

\
\
To build the service , just type
> With Phi-2 , type :
> 
> *make build*
> 
> or
> 
> With mistral, type :
> 
> *make FEATURE=mistral build*

\
\
Then, to run it, 
> *make run*


\
\
Once launched, to use the API, you can
> * From a linux terminal, use curl
>  * curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --no-buffer 'http://127.0.0.1:3030/token_stream' -d '{"query":"Where is located Paris ?"}'
> * From a browser, a very simple UI is available at :
>  * http://127.0.0.1:3030/



# You can  specify a custom model, and a tokenizer file
Provided these models are compatible with phi-2 or mistral , you can specify your own huggingface repo 
and quantized file , as well as customer tokenizer repo ( usually model file and tokenizer are on a different repo).
\
\

> You can type:
> 
> make FEATURE=mistral build
> 
> make run MODEL_REPO="Your quantized model repo" MODEL_FILE="Your quantized gguf file" TOKENIZER_REPO="Your tokenizer repo"

This is useful should you be willing to run a fine tuned version of either phi-2 or mistral 

\
\
For example, here is a phi-2 model fine tuned using guidelines described in the tutorial
https://youtu.be/J0RbOtLrJhQ?si=2lcEAzxX-ToeMPWR

> make run MODEL_REPO="fcn94/phi-2-finetuned-med-text" MODEL_FILE="model-v2-q4k.gguf" TOKENIZER_REPO="fcn94/phi-2-finetuned-med-text"

You can test the following prompt with standard phi-2 model and with this fine-tuned model
 
> curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --no-buffer 'http://127.0.0.1:3030/token_stream' -d '{"query":"I have a headache with low fever. What should I do ?"}'


\
\
\
NB :
For now, this only works for gguf files generated by 'tensor-tools' from candle

If you want to run llm from gguf file of most popular repo, then you can go to this repo

# You can  specify a context type ( general, sql, classifier, math)
Four context prompts are defined in ./config/prompt_comfig.toml

> You can type :
>
> for default ( general)
> 
> make run
> 
> or
> 
> for classifier
> 
> make run CONTEXT_TYPE=classifier
> 
> or
> 
> for sql
> 
> make run CONTEXT_TYPE=sql
> 
> or
> 
> for math
> 
> make run CONTEXT_TYPE=math
